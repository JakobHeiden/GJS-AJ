Based on GJS 11 by GameRat and Steiner
GJS originally made for CC5 and ported to LSA by Cathartes and others

All changes:
- reworked experience levels: german security forces have exp 1, osttruppen 2, AB 4, RM 5, all else 3. +1 for snipers, command teams, and veterans. -1 for
green and ersatz teams.
- fixed the magny-bayeux road bug
- made all large hedgerows in Bois du Bavent into small hedgerows
- gave the small bottom right island in Caen a vl
- gave PIAT Groups a 2nd PIAT
- fixed the broken building in Colombelles; made all light grey houses consistently L3
- removed the courtyards on Caen that are actually accessible to tanks (courtyard is a terrain type that is open, but inaccessible for tanks, to denote an area that is walled off somehow)
- added umlauts where appropriate, and some more minor german text fixes
- moved exit vls in Port-en-Bessin, Le Hamel/Arromanches, Courseulles Sur Mer
