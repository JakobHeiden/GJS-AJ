Based on GJS 11 by GameRat and Steiner
GJS originally made for CC5 and ported to LSA by Cathartes and others

All changes:
- reworked experience levels: german security forces have exp 1, osttruppen 2, AB 4, RM 5, all else 3. +1 for snipers, command teams, scouts/recce/aufklärer/späher, and veterans. -1 for green and ersatz teams.
- reworked some of the static BGs such that axis should have a chance to hold one turn on all maps
- fixed the magny-bayeux road bug
- made all large hedgerows in Bois du Bavent into small hedgerows
- gave the small bottom right island in Caen a vl
- gave PIAT Groups a 2nd PIAT
- HMG42 now fires 11 rounds per burst, to make it more effective than the MG42
- fixed the broken building in Colombelles; made all light grey houses consistently L3
- removed the courtyards on Caen that are actually accessible to tanks (courtyard is a terrain type that is open, but inaccessible for tanks, to denote an area that is walled off somehow)
- added umlauts where appropriate, and some more minor german text fixes
- moved exit vl in Port-en-Bessin to align with the road
- moved exit vls in Le Hamel/Arromanches, Courseulles Sur Mer to make them not trivial to reach for allies
- copied personal flamethrower coding from Radzymin 4.01 (thx Aetius!)
- renamed Sherman I team to Sherman Hybrid I
